# Student Grades Analysis

This Python project analyzes student grades across various subjects and semesters. It provides insights such as which students failed a subject, the highest-performing students, and the hardest subjects. Additionally, it generates visualizations to illustrate average scores per subject and the overall average score per semester.

## Features

1. **Failed Students**: Identifies students who failed any subject (score < 50).
2. **Average Grades by Semester**: Calculates the average grade for each subject across semesters.
3. **Highest Average Grade**: Finds the student(s) with the highest overall average grade across all subjects and semesters.
4. **Hardest Subject**: Identifies the subject with the lowest average score across all semesters.
5. **Consistently Improving Students**: Finds students who have consistently improved their average grades across semesters.
6. **Bar Chart for Average Scores per Subject**: Generates a bar chart showing the average score for each subject.
7. **Line Graph for Average Overall Score by Semester**: Generates a line graph showing the overall average score across all semesters.
